<h3>I am Mohd Farhan my nick name is Farru so I decided to put name of application FarruNyTimes<br/>

Build a simple app to hit the NY Times Most Popular Articles API and show a list of articles, that shows details when items on the list are tapped (a typical master/detail app).  We'll be using the most viewed section of this API.  http://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/mostviewed/{section}/{period}.json?api- key=sample-key To test this API, you can use all-sections for the section path component in the URL above and 7 for period (available period values are 1, 7 and 30, which represents how far back, in days, the API returns results for).
